### Abstract

We investigate the problem of characterizing the optimal variance proxy for sub-Gaussian random variables, whose moment-generating function exhibits bounded growth at infinity. We apply a general characterization method to discrete random variables with equally spaced atoms. We thoroughly study 3-mass distributions, thereby generalizing the well-studied Bernoulli case. We also prove that the discrete uniform distribution over  points is strictly sub-Gaussian. Finally, we provide an open-source Python package that combines analytical and numerical approaches to compute optimal sub-Gaussian variance proxies across a wide range of distributions.
